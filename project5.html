        <p>
          FWTHORN is the next project where I built a personal brand across
          social media and a website. Through this account I document daily
          life and show what I do to live well, based on how I currently see it
          and the studies I follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I record my workouts, the projects I work on, how I shop, and the
          routines I keep. The content also promotes RealityCheck and supports
          a healthy, goal-focused lifestyle. Many men my age feel lost and
          procrastinate at home or in a job until they realize at 30 or 40 what
          they could have done in their early twenties. FWTHORN is meant to be
          a practical, motivating counterexample.
