          The creative track at the Waidhofen secondary school allowed me to
          combine technology and design. Through smaller media exercises, I
          learned how to structure presentations, turn ideas into reality, and
          work in a team.
        </p>

          During feedback meetings, I was often told I was sometimes
          underchallenged &ndash; especially in English. At the same time, my
          enthusiasm for technology, video games, and early programming
          experiments (like small batch games) increased my ambition. Through
          online connections, I learned English quickly and enjoyed it, soon
          becoming one of the best in class.

          The advice of my older brother and my own experiences strengthened
          the desire to take the next step at HTL Krems.
        </p>
        <p>What shaped me most during this time:</p>
        <ul class="detail__list">
          <li>
            Voluntary participation in Spanish classes (afternoons after
            regular school).
          </li>
          <li>Musical and creative performances (twice a year).</li>
          <li>Among the best in class in almost every subject for years.</li>
          <li>
            First interest in programming through simple batch-file games.
          </li>
          <li>English Weeks with small class projects.</li>
