          Superstruct is a 3D Unity game we built as a school project. The
          central elevator acts as a hub between multiple floors packed with
          minigames. In each section, players collect resources to power the
          elevator and unlock the next level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each floor presents its own scenario &ndash; from dexterity sequences to
          small puzzle rooms. That creates a loop of exploring, collecting, and
          upgrading that keeps players motivated to climb higher.

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The code organizes floors as individual Unity scenes that the
          elevator loads at runtime. A resource manager tracks which items are
          earned in minigames and which upgrades those items can fund. The door
          to the next floor only opens once enough material is collected.
        </p>
        <h2>Core Gameplay Features</h2>

          <li>
            Three minigame types (dexterity, reaction, resource puzzle) that
