          My civil service at the Red Cross combines technical affinity with
          direct help for people. In emergency medical services, I support
          response teams, keep equipment in shape, and learn to stay focused
          under pressure.
        </p>
        <p>Areas of responsibility:</p>
        <ul class="detail__list">
          <li>
            Assisting in emergency medical services and accompanying emergency
            responses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Maintaining and documenting response vehicles and equipment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Up to 400 km of driving in a single day while transporting
            patients. Primary area: Waidhofen an der Thaya, with assignments
            also taking me to Vienna, St. P&ouml;lten, and across the edges of
            Lower Austria.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I successfully completed the emergency medical technician exam and am
          planning to continue as a volunteer at the Red Cross.
